procedure-oriented way of programming - designing a program around functions and logic

object oriented programming - organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming
1. A class creates a new type
2. objects are instances of the class
