0x05. Python - Exceptions

Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors:
The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected

The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow


Exceptions:
These are errors detected during execution and are not unconditionally fatal

The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message

Types of exceptions: ZeroDivisionError; NameError; TypeError

There are built-in exceptions and user-defined exceptions
